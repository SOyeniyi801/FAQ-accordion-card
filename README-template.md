## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Screenshot

![](design/solutionShot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the position attribute and how to use it to move items across the page. I also learned about layouts overall, and how to place certain elements where they should be. Making the page responsive was a challenge for me without specs, I used the chrome dev tools to preview element placements before coding.



If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I would like to practice more layout based projects because that is #1 in front end.

- [w3schools breakpoints](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp) - This helped me figure out how to set breakpoints to make the page responsive
